* Add another apolloClient to your application with the schema you will create.
* This graphQL editor enables you to create your schema and use it in your app :

* The uri of your schema will be visible in the black bottom part, once you save your project.

* The only thing you have to write now, it a chat application in each conference detail.

Good luck
