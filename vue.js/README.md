## Backend

- Want to see how a schema is written in nodeJS?
- Add another apolloClient to your application with the schema you will create.
- This graphQL editor enables you to create your schema and use it in your app :
- https://launchpad.graphql.com/

- The uri of your schema will be visible in the black bottom part, once you save your project.

- The only thing you have to write now, it a chat application in each conference detail.

Good luck
